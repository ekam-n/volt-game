# IAT 167 Final Project - Volt Legacy
A challenging platformer game made completely from scratch in Processing. 

## Main Concepts Used
The concepts that were used to create the game include inheritance and polymorphism. These allowed me to create multiple different types of blocks, characters, abilities, etc. and integrate them into gameplay together seamlessly.

## Configuration Notes
Using Processing Version 4.3.
Must run source code in Processing for pde files to work.
Must place all files in a folder named "main" otherwise Processing will complain.
